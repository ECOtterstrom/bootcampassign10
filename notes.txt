create a questions.js file, then require it and call it where needed
ask employee type
asyncs and awaits helped in the app.js when you are calling questions, await each question

switch(data.type{0}) {
case Manager (awaits are in here)
case engineer 
case intern
}

use above to call the different category of employee

constEmployeeArray[];
employeeArray.push(employeeObject); *much later or in a different file

require each employee type file in the server.js file, create constEmployee = require("./Employee");
class Engineer extends Employee{
    constructor(name, id, email, github) {

    }
}

above is similar to vehicle and car to extends

w3 schools for constructors will help, must use extend and super to add new classes

use readme, copy out of class activities, about 3 tests will work, once the library files are working the tests should work
then get the app.js file to work correctly with the questions

const Manager = require("./lib/Manager"); *at top of app.js
Engineer
Intern
inquirer
path
fs
